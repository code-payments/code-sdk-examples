# Code SDK Examples
This repository contains complete examples of using the Code SDK in a variety of languages and frameworks. The examples are intended to be used as a reference for developers integrating Code into their applications. This repository will grow over time as new features are added to the SDK.

If you're looking for a quick start, you should probably refer to either the [documentation](https://sdk.getcode.com) or the [minimal examples](https://github.com/code-wallet/code-sdk/tree/main/examples) instead.


## Quick Start
Each example has its own `Makefile`, which can be used to build and run the package inside a docker container. Additionally, you can use `npm run dev` to run the local development environment.

## Getting Help
