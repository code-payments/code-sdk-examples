# Article Paywall

This is a bit of a contrived example but should help get you started with the [Code SDK](https://sdk.getcode.com) using `Node.js`. It's a simple paywall that allows you to read an article if you have paid. If you haven't paid, you'll be prompted to pay for the article.

You can view the live example [here](https://sdk-example.getcode.com/).

We've deliberately kept this example simple to make it easy to understand. So, no fancy React / Vue / Angular / Svelte / etc. Just plain old HTML (EJS), CSS, and JavaScript.

## Quick Start
You can either run `npm run dev` if you have Node.js and npm installed locally, or you can run `make run-local` to run the example in a docker container.
